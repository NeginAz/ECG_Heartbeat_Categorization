# ECG Heartbeat Categorization Project

## Introduction

This project involves building a machine learning model to classify ECG signals into distinct heartbeat categories using the ECG Heartbeat Categorization Dataset. The objective is to create a robust classification model, enhance data diversity through augmentation, and develop a deployment-ready solution with a focus on model performance and real-world applicability.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset used for this project is sourced from Physionet's MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset. It consists of 109,446 samples categorized into five classes of heartbeat types: Normal (0), Supraventricular ectopic (1), Ventricular ectopic (2), Fusion (3), and Unknown (4). The ECG signals are preprocessed, segmented, and sampled at 125 Hz, with each segment representing a single heartbeat with 187 data points.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Processing:** Perform EDA, apply data augmentation, and handle missing data.
2. **Model Training:** Develop a CNN-LSTM model, handle class imbalance, and optimize performance.
3. **Testing on Holdout Set:** Simulate data shifts and evaluate performance.
4. **Deployment:** Implement a Flask API for model inference and discuss deployment strategies.

## Data Processing
- **EDA:** Visualized class distribution and identified data imbalance.
- **Data Augmentation:** Implemented with Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) and custom augmentation class (`DataAugmentation`).
- **Feature Engineering:** Added statistical features such as mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.
- **Handling Imbalance:** Synthetic samples generated using GMM for minority classes.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Before training any model, we conducted an in-depth analysis of the dataset:

- Dataset Structure: Checked the dimensions of both the training and test sets.
- Sample Inspection: Observed a few samples of ECG signals to understand their nature.
- Class Distribution: Visualized the distribution of heartbeat categories to assess dataset balance.
- Feature Statistics: Computed statistical properties of the train and test sets.

###  2.Data Preparation
 - Dataset Splitting:
    - Created a validation set from the training set to ensure fair model evaluation.
    Divided the test set into:
    - Regular Test Set (used for final evaluation).
    - Holdout Set (later used to test model robustness against noisy and shifted data).
    The validation set was balanced, meaning each class had an equal number of samples. 

### 3. Data Augmentation Techniques
 
To handle the class imbalance issue, we experimented with three augmentation strategies:

#### 3.1 Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)

We trained Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) on the minority classes.
The trained GMMs generated synthetic ECG signals to augment the dataset.


#### 3.2 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
-  Implemented multiple versions of GAN-based signal generation, inspired by prior -  research on ECG synthesis.
- The generator models were designed using LSTM and CNN layers to capture temporal dependencies.
- The discriminator networks used 1D Convolutional layers to distinguish real and fake signals.

#### 3.3 Resampling (Upsampling)
Used bootstrapping (resampling with replacement) to duplicate underrepresented class samples.
The goal was to increase representation without introducing synthetic data.

### 4. Additional Pre-Training Augmentation
Before training, additional data augmentation techniques were applied directly to the original ECG signals to improve model generalization:

#### 4.1. Time Shifting
Each ECG signal was shifted slightly forward or backward in time.
Helps the model become invariant to phase shifts, making it more robust.
#### 4.2. Noise Addition

Random Gaussian noise was added to the signals to simulate real-world variations.
Prevents overfitting and forces the model to learn more generalizable features.

### 5. Model Selection and Training
Implemented a CNN-LSTM hybrid model for ECG classification.

### 6. Model Evaluation
Evaluated the model on the validation set and test set.
Used metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
Compared model performance across datasets with and without augmentation.

### 7. Robustness Testing on Holdout Set
Introduced noise and time shifts to test model stability.
Assessed how well the model generalized under data distribution shifts.

### 8. Model Deployment Strategy
Designed an inference pipeline to make real-time predictions on ECG data.
Discussed deployment considerations including scalability, versioning, and monitoring.

- **API:** Developed a Flask API (`app.py`) to accept CSV uploads and predict heartbeat classes.
- **Frontend:** Simple web interface for file upload and result display.
- **Model Inference:** The API loads the trained model (`saved_model.h5`) and processes input data.

## Key Takeaways

Data augmentation significantly improved classification performance, especially for underrepresented classes.
GANs were the most effective method for generating realistic ECG waveforms, but GMM-based augmentation was computationally cheaper.
The model was sensitive to data shifts and noise, requiring additional robustness testing.

## Future Work

- Enhance feature engineering with domain-specific ECG metrics.
- Explore advanced augmentation techniques.
- Consider model ensemble strategies to improve minority class performance.
