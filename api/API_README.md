## Flask App for ECG Classification
I implemented a Flask-based web application to serve the ECG classification model, allowing users to upload ECG signal data in CSV format and receive heartbeat classification predictions. The app consists of:

### Flask Backend (app.py):
- It provides an API endpoint (/upload) that accepts CSV files, processes them, and predicts heartbeat categories using the trained model.
- The server loads the trained deep learning model, preprocesses the input data, and returns predictions in JSON format.
- Handles errors gracefully, ensuring robustness when processing uploaded files.
### Frontend (index.html):
- A simple web interface where users can upload ECG signal CSV files.
- Uses JavaScript (Fetch API) to send files to the Flask server and display the predicted results.
- Handles errors if an invalid file is uploaded or if the server response fails.
### How It Works:
- Users navigate to the web interface and select an ECG signal file.
- The file is sent to the Flask server, where it is processed and classified.
- The server responds with predicted heartbeat categories, which are then displayed in the browser.

## Deployment

I have implemented a Flask app to serve our ECG classification model, and the next step is deploying it efficiently for real-world use. Since our API needs to be accessible to users (e.g., doctors, researchers, or real-time monitoring systems), we must ensure a reliable and scalable deployment setup. Here are some possible deployment strategies:

- Cloud Server Deployment: Host the Flask app on AWS EC2, Google Cloud Compute Engine, or Azure VM, install Flask, TensorFlow, and dependencies, and run the app using Gunicorn for better performance.
- Docker: Package the application into a Docker container for consistent deployment across environments.
- Kubernetes: Recommended for large-scale projects with high traffic, enabling auto-scaling and efficient resource management.
To ensure smooth updates and prevent disruptions, we incorporate:

- Model Versioning: Store trained models with proper versioning and track experiments using MLflow.
- Automated Deployment: Use GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CI/CD pipelines for seamless integration and updates.
For scalability, we consider:

- Batch Inference: Optimizing predictions by processing multiple samples at once.
- GPU Acceleration: Utilizing AWS GPUs or Google TPUs for faster computations.
- Model Optimization: Converting models to TensorFlow Lite for improved efficiency.
To monitor real-world performance, we track:

- API Requests, Latency, and Errors: Using Prometheus & Grafana for real-time monitoring.
- Misclassified Samples: Logging predictions to detect performance drift and improve future models.
For security, we implement:

- API Keys & Authentication: Restricting unauthorized access.
- DDoS Protection: Using Cloudflare or AWS Shield to prevent attacks.
- Data Encryption: Ensuring secure transmission and storage of sensitive ECG data.

This strategy ensures robust, scalable, and secure deployment while maintaining model reliability in production.


### Run the Flask App
