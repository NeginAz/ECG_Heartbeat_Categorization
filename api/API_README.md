## Flask App for ECG Classification
I implemented a Flask-based web application to serve the ECG classification model, allowing users to upload ECG signal data in CSV format and receive heartbeat classification predictions. The app consists of:

### Flask Backend (app.py):
- It provides an API endpoint (/upload) that accepts CSV files, processes them, and predicts heartbeat categories using the trained model.
- The server loads the trained deep learning model, preprocesses the input data, and returns predictions in JSON format.
- Handles errors gracefully, ensuring robustness when processing uploaded files.
### Frontend (index.html):
- A simple web interface where users can upload ECG signal CSV files.
- Uses JavaScript (Fetch API) to send files to the Flask server and display the predicted results.
- Handles errors if an invalid file is uploaded or if the server response fails.
### How It Works:
- Users navigate to the web interface and select an ECG signal file.
- The file is sent to the Flask server, where it is processed and classified.
- The server responds with predicted heartbeat categories, which are then displayed in the browser.

## Deployment

I have implemented a Flask app to serve our ECG classification model, and the next step is deploying it efficiently for real-world use. Since our API needs to be accessible to users (e.g., doctors, researchers, or real-time monitoring systems), we must ensure a reliable and scalable deployment setup. Here are some possible deployment strategies:


The Flask app can be deployed on cloud platforms like AWS or GCP or packaged into a Docker container for easier deployment and consistency across environments. To ensure smooth updates and maintain model reliability, tracking model versions and monitoring prediction logs are crucial. This helps detect performance issues, identify misclassified samples, and continuously improve the model. Security is also a key factor; API keys and authentication should be implemented to restrict unauthorized access and protect sensitive data.

For scalability, assigning unique request IDs when using an API helps track user interactions and streamline debugging. To reduce latency, batch inference can optimize performance by processing multiple requests simultaneously. If traffic increases significantly, replicating the model across multiple instances ensures that the system remains responsive and can handle high demand without performance degradation. This strategy ensures robust, scalable, and secure deployment while maintaining model reliability in production.


### Run the Flask App

```sh
cd api
python app.py
```
